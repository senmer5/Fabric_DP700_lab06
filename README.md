# ðŸ“Š Microsoft Fabric Lab â€“ Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this lab is to learn how to analyze data within a **data warehouse** using the Microsoft Fabric environment. Throughout the lab, essential concepts of data warehousing are practiced, such as data modeling, analyzing data with SQL queries, defining relationships, and data visualization.

## ðŸ§© Use Case

Data warehouses, which are commonly used for large-scale analytics, differ from traditional databases in that they store data in a relational structure and offer full SQL capabilities.  
This lab is designed to teach the fundamentals of business intelligence and data analytics by connecting **dimensions** (such as product, customer, and date) with **facts** (such as sales).

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Steps (Non-Coding Overview)

1. **Create a Workspace**  
   A new workspace was created on the Microsoft Fabric homepage, using the active Fabric trial license.

2. **Create a Data Warehouse**  
   Inside the workspace, a new **data warehouse** was set up to host and manage structured data.

3. **Create Tables and Insert Data**  
   - A product table was manually created and populated with sample product data.  
   - Then, using a script, additional tables (customer, date, sales) were created to complete the data warehouse schema.

4. **Define the Data Model**  
   - Relationships were created between the fact table (`FactSalesOrder`) and the dimension tables (`DimProduct`, `DimCustomer`, `DimDate`).  
   - These relationships enabled meaningful cross-table analysis.

5. **Query the Data**  
   - SQL queries were used to analyze sales revenue by year, month, and sales region.  
   - Views were created to simplify and organize the analysis results.

6. **Use Visual Query (No-Code Analysis)**  
   - Without writing any SQL, tables were joined using drag-and-drop functionality, and product data was filtered and analyzed visually.

7. **Visualize the Data**  
   - Unnecessary columns were hidden to clean the report view.  
   - Charts and graphs were created using the built-in visualization tool, similar to Power BI, to make the data more understandable.

## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned

- How to create a workspace and data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric  
- How to create tables, insert data, and run queries using SQL  
- How to establish relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- How to clean and optimize the data model for visualization  
- How to use visual queries for no-code analysis  
- How to build basic reports using tools similar to Power BI

This lab provides an excellent foundation for anyone interested in working with data warehouse architecture.  
The hands-on practice with realistic examples such as sales analysis helps reinforce theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.
